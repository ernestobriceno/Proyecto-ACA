# Chat Integration Audit

This document verifies the correct integration of the group chat example under `chat/`.

## Installation
- `npm install` succeeds without errors.
- `npm start` runs the server which serves the HTML page on port 3000.

## Testing
- Accessing `http://localhost:3000` returns the chat HTML page.
- `npm test` fails as expected because no tests are specified.

No additional issues were detected.
