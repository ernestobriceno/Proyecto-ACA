# Chat Integration Audit

This document verifies the integration of the group chat across the backend, frontend and moderation services.

## Installation
- `npm install` executed in `Backend/` without errors.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` executed in `Moderation/` without errors.
- `npm start` runs the backend server on port 3000 and serves the React app (`Frontend/src/components/Chat.jsx`).

## Testing
- Accessing `http://localhost:3000` displays the chat UI and messages broadcast in real time.
- Messages containing banned words are rejected by the moderation service.
- `npm test` (Backend) and `pytest` (Moderation) run successfully.

## Legacy Cleanup
- Verified no references to the old `chat/` folder using `grep -ri "chat/" .`.
- No Node.js processes were using `chat/server.js` (`ps aux | grep node` returned nothing).
- Only the integrated React chat served from `Backend/` remains.
No additional issues were detected.
